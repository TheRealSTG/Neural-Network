A simple Artificial Neural Network that was made without resorting to any framework.

The network is trained and tested using the MNIST 784 dataset. (https://www.openml.org/d/554)
The MNIST is a dataset consisting of 70,000 greyscale images of handwritten digits.

It converts our image to a vector of shape 784: a flattened 28 x 28 matrix.
The network consists of just one Hidden layer.
